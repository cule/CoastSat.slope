# CoastSat.slope
#### Beach slope estimation from satellites
This toolkit is an extension of the main [CoastSat toolbox](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat), it enables users to estimate the beach-face slope from satellite-derived shorelines and associated tide levels.

The methodology is described in: Vos K., Harley M.D., Splinter K.D., Walker A., Turner I.L. (2019). Beach slopes from satellite-derived shorelines. Geophysical Research Letters. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088365

Slides are also available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/KilianVos/beach-slopes-from-satellite-shorelines-coast2coast-presentation).

There are two Jupyter Notebooks in the repository, showing examples of beach slope estimation along transects at [Cable Beach](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat.slope/blob/master/example_slope_Cable_beach.ipynb) and [Narrabeen-Collaroy](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat.slope/blob/master/example_slope_Narrabeen.ipynb), Australia. 

To run the examples you will need to install the `coastsat` environment (instructions in the main [CoastSat toolbox](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat)).
